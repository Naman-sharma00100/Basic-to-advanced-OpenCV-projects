# Basic-to-advanced-OpenCV-projects
This is repository for my files on all my projects with the OpenCV library in python, starting from basic projects to more advanced ones. 

I have worked on multiple projects with different ideas using the OpenCV python library, It supports many functions and is quite useful. I have shared my codes here for those projects. 

You can see, test and work on these code files yourself and if you have anything to update regarding your own projects, pls send pull request.

I will  be updating these repository daily.
